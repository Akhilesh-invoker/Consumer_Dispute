Consumer Complaints Resolution

Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have been given detailed
consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If we are able to predict this,
consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are
handled as well as how persuasively the final conlusions are conveyed to them.
Our target here is to build prediction model for column "Consumer disputed".

Formal Problem Statement:

Our target here is to build prediction model so that you are able to predict which consumer is more likely to
dispute the resolution of a complaint i.e. we need to make predictions for the "Consumer disputed" column.
All the column names are self explanatory. We need to build your model on train data. Test data does not have
the response column "Consumer disputed", we need to predict those values and submit it in a csv format.

EVALUATION CRITERION:
In order to get a passing grade in this project we need to have the AUC score of at least 0.54 for our test data
